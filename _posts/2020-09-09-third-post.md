Our mission was to design and manufacture a stair climbing vehicle that can carry squash balls safely in the container with only two motors. We manufactured a stair climbing two-wheel vehicle implementing caterpillar design. Two BLDC 250W motors were used for the power. Check our product demonstration! <br>

<strong> Brainstorming </strong><br>

<div style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;"> 
We brainstormed the vehicle design. Red box in the picture below indicates our selection. To climb up the stairs, we chose caterpillar design and to carry squash balls, we selected swing design for the container. Right picture shows our first draft of the vehicle. Our design development is described at below. <br><br>

<strong> Design </strong><br>
<div style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;"> 
The pictures below are our final design. We used aluminum profiles for the vehicle frame. Upper frame makes a 45 degree slope at the front end to make ease of climbing action. Battery which takes a big part of total weight is located slightly back of the container. By setting center of mass at the rear end, it guarantees enough contact area when the vehicle reaches the inflection point of the stairs and can alleviate the swing. Rubber belts are implemented for tire, and pulleys are manufactured of aluminum and 3D printer. As we mentioned, the container is held with a swing. <br><br>
