Our mission was to design and manufacture a stair climbing vehicle that can carry squash balls safely in the container with only two motors. We manufactured a stair climbing two-wheel vehicle implementing caterpillar design. Two BLDC 250W motors were used for the power. Check our product demonstration! <br>

<strong> Brainstorming </strong><br>

<div style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;"> 
We brainstormed the vehicle design. Red box in the picture below indicates our selection. To climb up the stairs, we chose caterpillar design and to carry squash balls, we selected swing design for the container. Right picture shows our first draft of the vehicle. <br>
