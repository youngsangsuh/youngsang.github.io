We manufactured a stretchable strain sensor through UV laser sintering of Ag nanoparticles. Ag NP and CPI were spin coated on a silicon wafer, and UV laser power was controlled for stable crack generation. Because of fine crack structure, we checked that resistance increased as the sensor was stretched. <br>

<strong> Idea </strong> <br>
Sensitive strain sensors usually use crack structures. We can implement this structure by controlling laser power. Laser power controls the annealing status, and annealing status concludes the bond strength between the particles.
