We manufactured a stretchable strain sensor through UV laser sintering of Ag nanoparticles. Ag NP and CPI were spin coated on a silicon wafer, and UV laser power was controlled for stable crack generation. Because of fine crack structure, we checked that resistance increased as the sensor was stretched. <br>
