We manufactured a stretchable strain sensor through UV laser sintering of Ag nanoparticles. Ag NP and CPI were spin coated on a silicon wafer, and UV laser power was controlled for stable crack generation. Because of fine crack structure, we checked that resistance increased as the sensor was stretched. <br>

<strong> Idea </strong> <br>
<div style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 25px;">

Sensitive strain sensors usually use crack structures. We can implement this structure by controlling laser power. Laser power controls the annealing status of Ag NP, and annealing status concludes the bonding energy between the particles. If laser power is low, crack propagates continuously and leads to a failure. If laser power is high, crack does not occur and it is useless for a sensitive sensor. We used microscope to check the adequate laser power for stable crack generation. <br> <br>

To gain stretchability of the sensor, we implemented serpentine structure. This structure lowers the effective strain in small segments of the sensor and enables to sense wide variety of strain. <br>

  <strong> Silicon wafer coating </strong> <br>
  Before laser sintering process, we spin coated a silicon wafer with colorless PI and Ag NP 20 wt% solution. Silicon wafer has a low adhesive property and these coatings are easily removed by pincette. Hence, after laser sintering, we only have to peel off the sensor from the wafer. <br><br>
  CPI is our sensor board. Although we intended to manufacture a <strong>stretchable</strong> sensor, the reason we used a <strong>flexible</strong> film is that Ag NP itself is stretched through buckling not because of its own stretchability. If we use a stretchable film, Ag NP would be separated from the board because the board would not buckle like Ag NP. <br><br>

<br>
<strong> Serpentine design </strong> <br>
We used a serpentine design to manufacture a stretchable strain sensor. Edge of the sensor is cut by high laser power. It has to be high enough to cut the CPI layer below the Ag NP layer. At the interior, laser sinters Ag NP with adequate laser power. <br><br>

<strong> Laser power </strong> <br>
Through microscope observation, we found out that about 5 mW is adequate UV laser power to generate stable cracks. <br><br>

<strong> Laser sintering </strong> <br>
We sintered Ag NP according to the design by SAMLight software and galvanometer equipment. <br><br>
