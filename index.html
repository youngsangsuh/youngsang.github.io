Hi! My name is Youngsang Suh. I am a senior year undergraduate student at Seoul National University studying Mechanical Engineering.   


My research interests are fabrication and control of wearable electronics, assistive devices, and intimate human-machine interaction devices.   


This site contains several projects and research experiences that I have worked on.
