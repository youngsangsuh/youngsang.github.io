Interests <br>
</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">
My goal is to improve <strong>human maneuverability</strong> with my knowledge. Developing wearable devices for precise human gesture analysis or controlling dexterous manipulator with human interaction would be perfect examples. I am interested in fabrication and control of wearable electronics, assistive devices, and intimate human-machine interaction devices. <br>
